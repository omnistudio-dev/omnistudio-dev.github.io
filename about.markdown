Hi there. Welcome to OmniStudio Developer!

I am Richard Soto, just another Salesforce Developer. My journey with Salesforce started when I joined a consulting company in 2018.

I have experience building web applications on Salesforce Industries (SFI, formerly known as Vlocity): Energy & Utilities Cloud (Engie) and Financial Services & Insurance (Cigna Healthcare).

OmniStudio Developer is a place where you will find blog posts, articles and videos that you may found useful as a Salesforce developer.

Thank you for visiting.
